NOTES ON RUNNING THIS APP:

This application is uploading a high quality image to Google's servers and as a result it can use up data quickly. Please be aware of this and if you have limited data test this app while you are on wifi.

Additionally because of the large size of the upload it takes awhile to to display data. On average with the devlopers connection  it took around an average of 1 minute on an 18 Megbit connection.
